Problem:

<b>
An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.
</b>
<br /><br />
My Results:

<b>
11 / 11 test cases passed.<br />
Runtime: 2070 ms
</b><br /><br />

I think I was not so good but at least I passed all the tests in the second try, in the first try only 2 tests I didn't passed.
